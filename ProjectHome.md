The **Avatar Core framework** is used to construct and display avatar characters from individual avatar assets (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.) and, typically, an XML descriptor file describing their relationships.  The framework supports the use of libraries for predefined selections of interchangeable characteristics, each of which whose graphical assets can be either defined within the hosted client application or loaded in dynamically at runtime. The XML descriptors make it easy to load, edit, and save avatar definitions to be used at a later time.

The current implementation is done in ActionScript targeting Adobe's [Flash Player](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer). Additional details regarding the framework is discussed in the [Introduction](Introduction.md) section. For more information on how to get started with Avatar Core, see [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.md). Working demos using the framework is also available on the [Demos](Demos.md) page.

<img src='http://myavatareditor.com/images/logox32.png' alt='[My Avatar Editor Logo]' /> Avatar Core is an offshoot from [My Avatar Editor](http://www.myavatareditor.com) ([Blog](http://myavatareditor.blogspot.com)). The primary goal of the Avatar Core framework is to provide an alternate platform to My Avatar Editor for developers interested in developing custom avatar editor solutions.
